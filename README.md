# Week 7 Internship - Celebal Technologies

This repository contains the tasks and reports completed during my Week 7 internship at Celebal Technologies. The tasks primarily involve using SQL Server, Power BI, and DAX for creating reports, implementing calculations, and working with different functions.

## Tasks Overview

### 1. **Task 3: Report Creation Using DAX Techniques**
   - Implemented **15 DAX techniques** as part of the report-building process.
   - Applied **5 Date/Time functions** for data analysis.

### 2. **Task 2: Implement DAX Functions**
   - Implemented the following DAX functions using `CALCULATE`:
     - ALL
     - VALUES
     - ALLSELECTED

### 3. **Task 4: Power BI Licensing Overview**
   - Created a detailed document covering:
     - Types of Power BI Licensing
     - Differences between the types of licensing
     - Benefits of Power BI Premium over Power BI Pro
    
### 4. **Task 1: SQL Server Data Upload & Paginated Report**
   - Uploaded data to SQL Server (Note: Due to the large size of the data, it could not be uploaded to GitHub. Please contact me directly for access to the dataset).
   - Created a paginated report by using SQL Server as the data source.
   - Added a **Pie Visual** to the report.
   - Created a **Calculated Field** called "New Product Price" with the formula: `Product Price * 5`.
   - Created a **Table Visual** to display:
     - Brand Name
     - Customer Name
     - New Product Price (Calculated Field)
   - Created two parameters:
     - Survey Type
     - Year

## Technologies Used

- **Power BI** for creating interactive reports and dashboards.
- **DAX** for implementing advanced calculations.
- **SQL Server** as the data source.
- **Power Bi Report Builder** for making the Paginated Report. 

## How to Run the Report

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Download the data directly from the SQL Server database (due to the large size, it is not included in this repository).
3. Open the Power BI report in the Power BI Desktop.
4. Connect to your SQL Server to fetch the data.
5. Explore the visualizations, including pie charts, tables, and the calculated fields.

## Files in this Repository

- **Power BI Report** - The `.pbix` file with all the visualizations and calculations.
- **Power BI Licensing Overview** - A document explaining the licensing types and benefits.
